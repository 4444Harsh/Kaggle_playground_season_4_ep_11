# Exploring Mental Health Data
# Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 11
## Introduction


The notebook is designed to demonstrate essential steps in a data science workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning model development. This project provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and working with data for prediction tasks.


## Overview


Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: Your goal is to use data from a mental health survey to explore factors that may cause individuals to experience depression.
## Libraries Used

- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn) for modeling and evaluation

## Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using `pandas`, which reads the file into a DataFrame. This allows for flexible and powerful data manipulation in subsequent steps.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This section covers:
- Handling missing values.
- Renaming columns to make data manipulation easier and more intuitive.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook explores the dataset through:
- Basic commands like `head` and `info` to understand data structure.
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` to analyze the distribution of features and their relationships.

## Feature Engineering

New features are created or existing ones modified to improve the predictive power of the dataset, which is a critical step in enhancing model performance.

## Modeling

Machine learning models are built using libraries like scikit-learn. The process includes:
- Splitting data into training and test sets.
- Training different models such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
- Evaluating models based on metrics like accuracy or RMSE.

## Evaluation and Conclusion

The final section analyzes model performance and interprets the results based on the evaluation metrics. This helps in understanding the modelâ€™s strengths and potential areas for improvement.
